# SIN3B GTEX vs TCGA expression analysis and GEO melanoma expression analysis

The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) [Xena browser](http://xena.ucsc.edu/) was
accessed on 02 February 2022, to retrieve DESe2
normalized SIN3B expression and its protein-coding transcripts in normal skin
([Genotype-Tissue Expression, GTEx](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/) and tumor tissue samples ([The Cancer
Genome Atlas, TCGA](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga)). Additionally,
two microarray datasets with accession
numbers GSE8401 and GSE46517 were  retrieved from the GEO platform
([Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/))  to   assess
SIN3B gene expression comparing nevus, metastatic and primary melanoma
samples. The 39705_at probe which matches SIN3B transcripts was selected.
